This project is a simple Bash script that automatically installs a complete LAMP Stack — Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP — on an Ubuntu system, providing a fast, lightweight alternative to XAMPP for local web development. By running this script, developers can easily set up Apache as a web server, MySQL as the database, and PHP for server-side scripting, all configured with secure defaults. The script updates your system’s package index, installs and configures each component, restarts Apache, and verifies that the stack is running correctly, saving you from doing everything manually. This tool is ideal for students, developers, or anyone who wants to spin up a LAMP environment quickly using the command line, without extra GUI tools.
